I was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and am now based in New Haven, Connecticut.

I am currently a medical student at Yale. I also research questions in health policy for emerging medical technologies like drugs and devices. Before medical school, I studied Chemical Physics and Biology at Columbia and worked in life sciences consulting.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, taking photos, biking and spending time with family & friends.</span><div class="v2_7"></div><div class="v2_6"></div><div class="v2_8"></div><span class="v2_16">me in January 2022</span></div></body></html>
