		<p type="research_description"> 
			I generally focus my research on  health policy, thinking about how regulation & the law impact new medical technologies (e.g., drugs, devices, digital health).<br> <br>Prior to this, I researched computational genomics during the first half of medical school and chemical physics in college. <br><br>

			This page describes my health policy research highlighted by subtopic and includes a list of select publications at the bottom.  

<!-- 			Alternatively, you can find a full list of publications, conferences, and presentations <a href = "publications.html">here</a>.<br><br>

		<h4><br>Regulation & payment policies for medical devices</h4>
		<p type="research_description">
			
			How can government agencies ensure that medical device innovation is based on strong and representative clinical evidence?<br><br>

			Our <i>JAMA Cardiology</i> Special Communication explores the processes of FDA market authorization and Medicare coverage for new cardiovascular devices. Highlighting the Breakthrough Device Program, we proposed policy recommendations for FDA and CMS to promote rigorous evidence generation and proper use of Medicare funds <a href = "#r10">[10]</a>. <br><br>

<!-- 			This work was accompanied by <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2810733">an editorial</a> from the former CMS Chief Medical Officer touching on the importance of evidence-based medicine, along with <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2810731">an editor's note</a> concurring with our suggestions.  
 -->
<!-- 			CMS recently implemented policies that offer automatic payment to new, expensive medical devices authorized under the Breakthrough Devices Program (BDP), an expedited review pathway that allows FDA to accept more uncertainty in clinical benefits and risks for devices treating life-threatening conditions. We call attention to the risks of linking expedited development to mandatory payment, highlighting 3 examples of recent cardiovascular devices. 

			Our work shows that Breakthrough devices can reach the market based on limited clinical evidence that is often not representative of Medicare benficiaries. To remedy this problem, we outline policy proposals that FDA and CMS can take to ensure strong evidence informs clinical care.    -->

		<h4><br>Evidence standards for medical products</h4>
		<p type="research_description">
			We were curious if it was possible to rely on real-world evidence to answer clinical questions in pandemics.  <br><br>To answer this, we compared results from observational studies for Covid-19 drugs to results from randomized clinical trials (the gold standard) looking at the same exact treatments. We published our findings in <i>The BMJ </i>showing that observational studies and RCTs frequently agreed in their conclusions <a href = "#r7">[7]</a> <a href = "#r8">[8]</a>. This work informed the 2022 update of the Agency on Healthcare Research and Quality guidance for inclusion of nonrandomized studies in systematic reviews.
			
			
			<!-- *Note that observational studies are conducted by pulling data that already exists in patient charts, in contrast to the clinical trial approach which requires first recruiting patients, then testing a drug, and then collecting data.-->
		</p>
	


		<h4><br>Genetic testing: data privacy, innovation policy</h4>
		<p type="research_description">
			Health data is governed weirdly in the United States, and consumers often have to rely on company goodwill versus solid regulation. For <i>Nature Medicine</i>, we explored risks posed by the genetic testing industry (e.g., 23andMe) and proposed solutions for how consumers may be safeguarded  <a href = "#r5">[5]</a>. The National Society of Genetic Counselors referenced our regulatory analysis in their practice resource on elective genomic testing. 
		</p>

		<p type="research_description">	
			In separate work, we considered the testing industry from an innovation policy perspective <a href = "#r2">[2]</a>. Bad regulation allowed for the development of a Covid-19 testing monopoly, a phenomenon sharing parallels to the history of genetic testing. We argued aginst relying on exclusivity-creating patents to promote innovation and instead outlined a more effective reimbursement model. 
		</p>


		<h4><br>Postmarket regulation of medical products</h4>
		<p type="research_description">
			This series of work evaluated the performance of FDA postmarket studies  <a href = "#r3">[3]</a>  <a href = "#r4">[4]</a>  <a href = "#r6">[6]</a> <a href = "#r9">[9]</a>. These studies happen after a drug is already on the market and are increasingly important nowadays, as new drugs undergo less testing before approval. 
			<br> <br>We found that postmarket studies can lead to worthwhile outcomes, but often are delayed and not completed on time. We proposed increasing the FDA's authority to enforce evidence generation after drug approval. <br><br>
