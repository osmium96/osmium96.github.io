			65 Broadway St.<br>
			April 2022<br><br>
			I was about to start this entry by commenting on how there are both brown people and non-brown people at Sherkaan, something I found interesting because it means that the restaurateurs effectively targeted both audiences. But I don't want to dwell too much on this point, conscious of the <a href = "https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap"> authenticity trap </a> that can often plague non-Western businesses... So I'll leave it at that for now and maybe build on this thought later. <br><br>
			We have been to Sherkaan a number of times. On this night, Elle and I came with two of her friends visiting for the weekend. It was the the beginning of April, so we of course fell into the classic trap of pushing our good weather luck by sitting outside. It ended up being chillier than we bargained for, but we survived. On the plus side, we got to witness some excellent service in action from the waitstaff. We elected to sit next to a gas space heater, and our waitress took pains to make sure the heater worked. She first went out of her way to install a new propane tank and then frequently monitored the flame as the wind kept blowing it out. <br><br>
			Because the restaurant is tucked away off Broadway, the outdoor seating exposes you to some amount of foot traffic from undergrads and bookstore patrons. Nothing excessive or distracting, but worthy of note in case you're in the mood for people-watching or conversely would prefer a quieter setting. We didn't eat inside this time, but have on occasion before. The restaurant promotes itself as an "energetic space evok[ing] the feel of old-world, urban India." While I'm not quite sure what that means, the urban aesthetic definitely comes through. The space is designed with high ceilings, exposed brick walls adorned with large murals, and hanging filamentous light bulbs. A ceiling-mounted display of twenty or so bicycles flanks the corner of the restaurant. Compared to the outdoor seating, the inside is more ~vibey~ for sure. <br><br>
			Our food was delicious. Sherkaan's portion sizes are always quite generous, so we were happy with the amount we ordered.  Elle and I got the butter chicken and baingan bartha, opting for naan instead of rice. A fan favorite, the butter chicken does not disappoint but nor does it surprise. The tandoori chicken pieces were large misshapen cubes, immersed in a thick creamy tomato sauce. The baingan bartha was a vegan-friendly smoked eggplant (emphasis on the smoked) served in a roasted tomato sauce with cauliflower and chickpea medley. We ordered the eggplant as a substitute for our old favorite, Sherkaan's amazing fried okra that has since been removed from the menu. It rose to the challenge - you might say the baingan bartha was banging indeed (cue the snare drum, cymbals). We ate both entrees with naan, which was definitely the right call. I would place Sherkaan's naan in the list of top naans I have eaten. They aced on the two most important measures quality: achieving a crispy exterior dotted with flaky air bubbles coupled with a nice chewy, doughy interior.<br><br>
			Pro tip: always order more naan than you think you want; it will be eaten. <br><br>
			Overall: great, for a nice casual group dinner <br>
