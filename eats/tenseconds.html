			Ten Seconds Yunnan Rice Noodle

			Ten Seconds Yunnan Rice Noodle was a fun experience. Elle and I went there to celebrate passing Step 1. We were there on a Wednesday night and arrived at 8:00 pm, so the place was naturally pretty empty. The restaurant was lit in a yellow-white lighting, with large-ish tables (we sat at a four-top) and plenty of open space. The place felt like it could belong in your local suburb, which was charming to us for a quiet midweek dinner, but may not be your jam for a Friday night. The staff was attentive, nice, and earnest. The food was good, but left us wanting a a little more. We both agreed that the appetizers - fried gyoza, buns, and spicy cold cucumbers - were more exciting than the eponymous noodle dishes. While the presentation of the hot noodle bowls was a show, the broth tasted as if it had been slightly diluted. By no means was the meal unpleasant. We were just not too impressed. <br><br>
			Overall: good, not great.<br>
