			39 High St. <br>
			March 2022<br><br>
			The first time I heard about Olea, I was attending an  event at the Dean's house, and we were all standing awkwardly in a circle exchanging small talk. Olea was the Dean's response to my question about his favorite restaurant in New Haven. He made sure to preface this by saying that he would usually go to New York for nice dinners, but he deemed Olea and Union League Cafe suitable enough venues to take would-be faculty candidates after interviews. I hope this already starts to paint a picture about what kind of place Olea is. <br><br>
			Funny enough, the two times I have eaten there were  associated with Yale Med faculty spottings. Come to think of it, that might be the Elm City equivalent of LA celebrity sightings. <br><br>
			Near the end of March, we ate inside Olea for the first time in a group of four for Elle's birthday. We had previously been during restuarant week in the first year of the pandemic and were looking forward to finally seeing the main dining room. Olea did not disappoint. The lighting was nice, diffuse and dim enough to set a comfortable mood. Rather than each have our own entree/separate dishes, we decided to order with the intention of sharing (as we often do). The service was extremely attentive, and I appreciated their consideration of small details (e.g., accomodating our preference to share, rearranging the plates for everyone's convenience, adding an extra croqueta so that there would be exactly four). We did all note that our waiter appeared uninterested, maybe because we were a young group of POCs amidst a sea of white people? At least this didn't interfere with the actual dining experience. <br><br>
			We had the pulpo, croquetas, scallops, pato, patatas, and pimientos. For dessert we had the torrija. Olea lived up to the hype. The food was above average good, worthy of the premium price tag. Of course you can never go wrong with croquetas, so it may not be a surprise that we enjoyed them. The pulpo, interestingly delivered as a single octopus leg, was tender and avoided the rubbery texture pitfall that sometimes happens to octopus. The scallops were deliciously butter and topped with a slightly acidic ensemble of vegetables (seemingly a citrus-y variant of pico). The pato, glazed in a sweet brown jus situated next to a parsnip puree, stole the show for me. Rolling off a few bad experiences with dry poultry, I admittedly did not know what to expect at first with the medium-well seared duck breast, but Olea nailed the execution. (Side note: duck intrigues me, because it's technically white meat like chicken but has the consistency of a darker meat - maybe the best of both worlds?) For our sides we enjoyed the patatas, which were the usual fare of Spanish fingerling potatoes with an aioli sauce, along with the pimientos, better than usual shishito peppers but less salt than you might expect. We don't typically do dessert, but the occasion called for it. The torrija was a golden-brown crusted brioche soaked in milk served alongside a single scoop of honey ice cream, a perfect cap to an amazing meal. <br><br>
			I don't think you can go wrong eating at Olea, but if pharma isn't <a href = "https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/66489"> adding Ms to your bank account</a>, maybe save it for the big nights. 
			<br><br>
			Overall: great, for special occasions.<br>
