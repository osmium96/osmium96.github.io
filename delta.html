	I am interested in tackling problems in mental healthcare delivery. <br><br>
    Specifically, I am excited to address the challenge of matching patients to
    effective psychiatric medications that actually work for them. I use the
    word “matching” because good prescription drugs already exist for common
    mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, or ADHD. But figuring out
    the right drug for a patient is a very individual question, unlike the
    analogous drug prescribing question for choosing an antibiotic for example.
    Moreover, there are not many reliable indicators to predict which patients
    respond to which drugs. The best approach today is trial and error, with
    patients iterating through multiple medications until finding the right
    match. <br><br>Right now, a patient may be prescribed 10 mg of Prozac as a
    first-line medication for their depression. Then, they would be asked to try
    the drug for a month and see if it works. If the drug works, all works out.
    If the drug does not work, then they will be switched to another medication.
    Rinse and repeat. The problem is – the first-line medications are not
    one-size-fits all. On top of that, it’s hard to know if a drug is “working”
    without any hard metrics to track. <br><br>The new medication onboarding experience
    is an extremely inefficient and frustrating process for a high percentage of
    patients, resulting in (1) significant waste during the on-boarding of a new
    patient and (2) many patients dropping out of potential treatment. <br><br>I think
    there is a market for solving this inefficiency, as anyone who pays for
    healthcare (whether that is an insurance company or an individual patient)
    has a vested interest in reducing wasted costs and ensuring continued
    treatment. <br><br>Other branches of medicine have the luxury of high-quality
    objective data to avoid this problem. Cardiology is the most storied field
    in data-driven medicine. Cardiologists can prescribe the exact cholesterol
    medication based on results from simple blood tests. Oncology is a field
    that has only recently started to solve this problem. Through the advent of
    more accessible and reliable genetic testing, oncologists can now also
    prescribe the exact chemo drugs. <br><br>Psychiatrists previously did not have good
    objective data to work with, but that is also not the case anymore. The boom
    in mental health tech over the past few years has illustrated the
    possibility of both generating and inferencing on mental health data sourced
    from patients. Companies like Sayana have already started to show the
    effectiveness of mood tracking, as related to predicting mental health
    outcomes. Other companies, like Cerebral, are interested in using biological
    data to inference mental health outcomes. I envision a solution similar to
    these endeavors but specifically related to the question of assigning
    treatments. <br><br>The decreasing stigma, expanding institutional resources,
    opportunity to rethink care delivery models in the post-pandemic landscape,
    rise in digital health, and more factors make now an exciting time to think
    about this problem. I’m excited to work toward a solution.

my qualifications</span>
<span class="i-have-worked">
i have worked across multiple domains relevant to the problem space</span>
<span class="v2_172">
    I have curated a diverse skillset that uniquely equips me to build a strong company in the mental health tech space. Below I briefly highlight my experiences in the following relevant domains: <br><br>

medicine, <br>
health law, <br>
business, <br>
and technical competency. <br>

<br>Medicine: This should be relatively straightforward - I have built up a strong fund of medical knowledge as a medical student. I have learned the fundamentals through my courses and talked to patients directly on my clinical rotations. <br>

<br>Health law: I am an active contributor to the national conversations on health policy, specifically for new health technologies. I have published papers analyzing the implications of the law on healthcare. For one example, I wrote in Nature Medicine about genetic privacy challenges for diagnostic tests from companies like 23andMe. Beyond my medical school curriculum, I am collaborating at Yale Law School.<br>

<br>Business: I have actual industry experience and business knowledge. In my former work as a strategy consultant, I advised several companies across healthcare and the life sciences. I understand the flow of capital, key stakeholder interactions, and unique payment structures that differentiate healthcare from other industries. I also know the challenges facing new health tech startups. For one of my projects, I advised a ~$5 B private equity firm in building out their digital health tech portfolio. This work involved me screening and analyzing over 500 startups and small/medium-sized businesses to eventually recommend a few final companies for acquisition. <br>

<br>Technical competency: I am technically competent with strong math/data science skills, and I am comfortable working with large datasets. For one recent example, I built out a novel analysis pipeline using Python and R that analyzed ~50 GB of genetic data and ultimately predicted which cancer treatment best matched a patient. This work was done over my first 1.5 years in medical school, with the manuscript in review. <br>
