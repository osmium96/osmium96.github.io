 		<h4>PAY TO PLAY</h4>

			“All clear...?” After a quick glance around the room, the cardiologist places their paddles on the patient’s chest and administers 90 J  of electrical energy to her heart. “Ahh!” The previously silent, motionless patient yelps. We all glance over to the monitor screen, waiting for the irregular heart rhythm to change. Nothing happens. “Let’s go up to 120 J and try again.” A senior resident dials up the knob to fulfill the order. Paddles go back on the chest. “All clear? Everyone clear?” Another shock. The patient yelps again. But this time she momentarily wakes up, blearily mumbling “How many shocks was that? I only paid for one shock…“ The anesthesia kicks back in, and she returns to her slumber. The monitor still shows atrial fibrillation. Dismayed, the cardiologist removes the paddles and begins packing up to prepare for their next patient. 

			<br><br>

			To be fair, I don’t think that patients pay for each individual shock administered but rather pay for the entire cardioversion procedure. Still, this anecdote illustrates the larger theme — that patients are very conscious about their healthcare costs. Financial constraints are a huge barrier to accessing medical services back home, so I don’t mean to claim that this problem is unique in Ghana — just that it manifests in a different way. 

			<br><br>

			Healthcare in the U.S. is also incredibly expensive, however the payment models for financing American healthcare differ from those for Ghanaian healthcare. The overwhelming majority of patients in the U.S. pay for healthcare through insurance (either private or public), which means that patients often are not the ultimate payer of the services they use. Here in Ghana, patients often pay for services directly rather than through the mechanism of insurance. National public insurance does exist, although it covers relatively fewer benefits and remains underutilized (<50%) and underfunded. As a result patients are both the users and payers of healthcare. 

			<br><br>

			Back home, it feels like healthcare costs are the big elephant in the room during doctor-patient interactions. Doctors bill insurers, who in turn charge patients monthly premiums and co-pays. Even though everyone knows medicine is expensive, doctors (as the servicers) and patients (as the users) weirdly enough don’t have to discuss money directly. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			In contrast to this culture of keeping mum, here at Korle Bu I have noticed that doctors and patients more readily talk about affordability and the cost-effectiveness of health services. During ward rounds earlier this week, a resident informed the consultant that our patient with was unwilling to pay for additional diagnostic testing. He had presented with shortness of breath due to a large volume of fluid surrounding his lungs, and the team wanted to analyze the cells (i.e., cytology) in this pleural fluid to better understand the cause. The consultant acknowledged that cytology provide useful information but pointed out that we could still pick up important clues through biochemical testing, a much cheaper option. In this low-resource environment where patients negotiate their own medical care, doctors are forced to think creatively about cost-effectiveness, unlike the high-resource setting approach of just ordering “comprehensive” panels of often-unnecessary tests.      
			<br><br>

			But thinking cost-effectively only works up to a certain point. Sometimes the only effective treatment options are still too expensive. I started seeing this phenomena more throughout this week as I got better acquainted with the cardiology fellows and faculty. Medications can control heart disease to a certain extent, but effective management often necessitates the use of invasive diagnostic and interventional procedures. One of the cardiology fellows informed me that patients pay 18,000 GHS (~$1,500 USD) for a coronary angiogram — a standard cardiac procedure that uses a catheter and x-rays to image the heart’s blood vessels. Placing a stent costs an additional 6,000 GHS ($500 USD). Meanwhile, the national minimum wage is currently 18 GHS (~$1.50 USD) per day. Many patients with unstable coronary artery disease are turned away because they cannot afford to pay.

			<br><br> 

			One morning, I came in early to see a patient whom I had met the previous day with my classmates. Though the team was focused on the gastrointestinal exam at the time, I noticed this twenty-year old patient’s left chest was quivering, and I heard someone off-handedly mention that he had a heart murmur. This piqued my curiosity, so I decided to look into the cardiac aspect of his case. After arriving at his bedside that next morning, I asked how he was doing and sought permission to do a cardiac exam. He told me he was not feeling well. He shared with me that his doctors diagnosed him with endocarditis. They said that he would need surgery to replace his heart valve, but the price was unaffordable. I listened to his heart, confirming what I suspected: a harsh, blowing murmur in the apex region suggestive of severe mitral regurgitation. This patient likely suffered from rheumatic fever previously, which damaged his mitral valve and led to his current condition. I lingered for a while longer, hearing out his grievances until I had to return upstairs for my morning session. I didn't feel great afterwards, knowing that I had just left a patient who might die not because the medical care does not exist, but because he cannot pay.
