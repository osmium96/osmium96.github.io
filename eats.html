		<h2>introduction</h2>
		<p type="citation"> 
			The question of where to eat may seem innocent at first glance, but it's not. Achieving the perfect dining experience isn't about eating at the fanciest place or spending a ton of money. Different restaurants work for different situations. In the quest to eat at the perfect place for a given night, there is a lot to consider: cost, cuisine, group size, day of the week, occasion, <em>vibe</em>, and more. It may be too ambitious of a task for me to take on completely, but I'll take a stab at it. <br> <br> 
			This page will host my reviews of New Haven restaurants. I'll share my thoughts about places I've eaten at with the hopes that it'll make your decision a little easier. I'm still experimenting on style so bear with me, as the content may update or change after initial posting. <br><br>
			Don't worry, I'll skip all the pizza places.

			Ten Seconds Yunnan Rice Noodle
		</h3>
		<p type="citation"> 
			756 Chapel St. <a href="https://www.tensecondsyunnannoodle.com/"> [link]</a> <br>
			<br>Ten Seconds Yunnan Rice Noodle was a fun experience. Elle and I went there to celebrate passing Step 1. We were there on a Wednesday night and arrived at 8:00 pm, so the place was naturally pretty empty. The restaurant was lit in a yellow-white lighting, with large-ish tables (we sat at a four-top) and plenty of open space. The place felt like it could belong in your local suburb, which was charming to us for a quiet midweek dinner, but may not be your jam for a Friday night. The staff was attentive, nice, and earnest. The food was good, but left us wanting a a little more. We both agreed that the appetizers - fried gyoza, buns, and spicy cold cucumbers - were more exciting than the eponymous noodle dishes. While the presentation of the hot noodle bowls was a show, the broth tasted as if it had been slightly diluted. By no means was the meal unpleasant. We were just not too impressed. <br><br>
			Overall: good, not great.<br>
