		<h2>introduction</h2>
		<p type="citation"> 
			The question of where to eat may seem innocent at first glance, but it's not. Achieving the perfect dining experience isn't about eating at the fanciest place or spending a ton of money. Different restaurants work for different situations. In the quest to eat at the perfect place for a given night, there is a lot to consider: cost, cuisine, group size, day of the week, occasion, <em>vibe</em>, and more. It may be too ambitious of a task for me to take on completely, but I'll take a stab at it. <br> <br> 
			This page will host my reviews of New Haven restaurants. I'll share my thoughts about places I've eaten at with the hopes that it'll make your decision a little easier. I'm still experimenting on style so bear with me, as the content may update or change after initial posting. <br><br>
			Don't worry, I'll skip all the pizza places.

			Ten Seconds Yunnan Rice Noodle
		</h3>
		<p type="citation"> 
			756 Chapel St. <a href="https://www.tensecondsyunnannoodle.com/"> [link]</a> <br>
			April 2022<br><br>
			Ten Seconds Yunnan Rice Noodle was a fun experience. Elle and I went there to celebrate passing Step 1. We were there on a Wednesday night and arrived at 8:00 pm, so the place was naturally pretty empty. The restaurant was lit in a yellow-white lighting, with large-ish tables (we sat at a four-top) and plenty of open space. The place felt like it could belong in your local suburb, which was charming to us for a quiet midweek dinner, but may not be your jam for a Friday night. The staff was attentive, nice, and earnest. The food was good, but left us wanting a a little more. We both agreed that the appetizers - fried gyoza, buns, and spicy cold cucumbers - were more exciting than the eponymous noodle dishes. While the presentation of the hot noodle bowls was a show, the broth tasted as if it had been slightly diluted. By no means was the meal unpleasant. We were just not too impressed. <br><br>
			Overall: good, not great.<br>

			Sherkaan

			April 2022<br><br>
			I was about to start this entry by commenting on how there are both brown people and non-brown people at Sherkaan, something I found interesting because it means that the restaurateurs effectively targeted both audiences. But I don't want to dwell too much on this point, conscious of the <a href = "https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/18/18183973/authenticity-yelp-reviews-white-supremacy-trap"> authenticity trap </a> that can often plague non-Western businesses... So I'll leave it at that for now and maybe build on this thought later. <br><br>
			We have been to Sherkaan a number of times. On this night, Elle and I came with two of her friends visiting for the weekend. It was the the beginning of April, so we of course fell into the classic trap of pushing our good weather luck by sitting outside. It ended up being chillier than we bargained for, but we survived. On the plus side, we got to witness some excellent service in action from the waitstaff. We elected to sit next to a gas space heater, and our waitress took pains to make sure the heater worked. She first went out of her way to install a new propane tank and then frequently monitored the flame as the wind kept blowing it out. <br><br>
			Because the restaurant is tucked away off Broadway, the outdoor seating exposes you to some amount of foot traffic from undergrads and bookstore patrons. Nothing excessive or distracting, but worthy of note in case you're in the mood for people-watching or conversely would prefer a quieter setting. We didn't eat inside this time, but have on occasion before. The restaurant promotes itself as an "energetic space evok[ing] the feel of old-world, urban India." While I'm not quite sure what that means, the urban aesthetic definitely comes through. The space is designed with high ceilings, exposed brick walls adorned with large murals, and hanging filamentous light bulbs. A ceiling-mounted display of twenty or so bicycles flanks the corner of the restaurant. Compared to the outdoor seating, the inside is more ~vibey~ for sure. <br><br>
			Our food was delicious. Sherkaan's portion sizes are always quite generous, so we were happy with the amount we ordered.  Elle and I got the butter chicken and baingan bartha, opting for naan instead of rice. A fan favorite, the butter chicken does not disappoint but nor does it surprise. The tandoori chicken pieces were large misshapen cubes, immersed in a thick creamy tomato sauce. The baingan bartha was a vegan-friendly smoked eggplant (emphasis on the smoked) served in a roasted tomato sauce with cauliflower and chickpea medley. We ordered the eggplant as a substitute for our old favorite, Sherkaan's amazing fried okra that has since been removed from the menu. It rose to the challenge - you might say the baingan bartha was banging indeed (cue the snare drum, cymbals). We ate both entrees with naan, which was definitely the right call. I would place Sherkaan's naan in the list of top naans I have eaten. They aced on the two most important measures quality: achieving a crispy exterior dotted with flaky air bubbles coupled with a nice chewy, doughy interior.<br><br>
			Pro tip: always order more naan than you think you want; it will be eaten. <br><br>
			Overall: great, for a nice casual group dinner <br>

		<h3>
			Olea
		</h3>
		<p type="citation"> 
			39 High St. <a href="http://www.oleanewhaven.com/"> [link]</a> <br>
			March 2022<br><br>
			The first time I heard about Olea, I was attending an  event at the Dean's house, and we were all standing awkwardly in a circle exchanging small talk. Olea was the Dean's response to my question about his favorite restaurant in New Haven. He made sure to preface this by saying that he would usually go to New York for nice dinners, but he deemed Olea and Union League Cafe suitable enough venues to take would-be faculty candidates after interviews. I hope this already starts to paint a picture about what kind of place Olea is. <br><br>
			Funny enough, the two times I have eaten there were  associated with Yale Med faculty spottings. Come to think of it, that might be the Elm City equivalent of LA celebrity sightings. <br><br>
			Near the end of March, we ate inside Olea for the first time in a group of four for Elle's birthday. We had previously been during restuarant week in the first year of the pandemic and were looking forward to finally seeing the main dining room. Olea did not disappoint. The lighting was nice, diffuse and dim enough to set a comfortable mood. Rather than each have our own entree/separate dishes, we decided to order with the intention of sharing (as we often do). The service was extremely attentive, and I appreciated their consideration of small details (e.g., accomodating our preference to share, rearranging the plates for everyone's convenience, adding an extra croqueta so that there would be exactly four). We did all note that our waiter appeared uninterested, maybe because we were a young group of POCs amidst a sea of white people? At least this didn't interfere with the actual dining experience. <br><br>
			We had the pulpo, croquetas, scallops, pato, patatas, and pimientos. For dessert we had the torrija. Olea lived up to the hype. The food was above average good, worthy of the premium price tag. Of course you can never go wrong with croquetas, so it may not be a surprise that we enjoyed them. The pulpo, interestingly delivered as a single octopus leg, was tender and avoided the rubbery texture pitfall that sometimes happens to octopus. The scallops were deliciously butter and topped with a slightly acidic ensemble of vegetables (seemingly a citrus-y variant of pico). The pato, glazed in a sweet brown jus situated next to a parsnip puree, stole the show for me. Rolling off a few bad experiences with dry poultry, I admittedly did not know what to expect at first with the medium-well seared duck breast, but Olea nailed the execution. (Side note: duck intrigues me, because it's technically white meat like chicken but has the consistency of a darker meat - maybe the best of both worlds?) For our sides we enjoyed the patatas, which were the usual fare of Spanish fingerling potatoes with an aioli sauce, along with the pimientos, better than usual shishito peppers but less salt than you might expect. We don't typically do dessert, but the occasion called for it. The torrija was a golden-brown crusted brioche soaked in milk served alongside a single scoop of honey ice cream, a perfect cap to an amazing meal. <br><br>
			I don't think you can go wrong eating at Olea, but if pharma isn't <a href = "https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/66489"> adding Ms to your bank account</a>, maybe save it for the big nights. 
			<br><br>
			Overall: great, for special occasions.<br>
