		<h1>notes from accra</h1>

		<p> 
			I am spending the month of February in Accra, Ghana, for a global health rotation at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital affiliated with University of Ghana Medical School. Both Ellelan and I came here together; she's rotating on cardiothoracic surgery, and I'm on the internal medicine wards. On this page, I'll post notes and photos from the experience.

			Friday February 16, 2024

			“All clear...?” After a quick glance around the room, the cardiologist places their paddles on the patient’s chest and administers 90 J of electrical energy to her heart. “Ahh!” The previously silent, motionless patient yelps<a href="accra/feb1624.html">...continue reading full post.</a>

 		<h4>NOTE 2: HARMATTAN</h4>
 		<h5>
			Thursday February 8, 2024
		</h5>
		<p>
			The air quality in Accra currently ranks as the worst in the world right now, reaching over 300 AQI this week. Just walking outside for a few minutes leads to a sore throat and watery eyes. Pollution paints the sky a flat concrete grey, erasing away the clouds and rendering the sun into a wispy orange-red orb<a href="accra/feb0824.html">...continue reading full post</a>

 		<h4>NOTE 1: FIVE DAYS IN</h4>
 		<h5>
			Saturday February 3, 2024
		</h5>
		<p>
			We arrived in Accra Tuesday night and spent the evening settling in to our place. Ellelan and I are renting an AirBnB near the Labone and La neighborhoods in Accra, which puts us about a 25 minute drive away from the hospital but closer to the downtown and beach<a href="accra/feb0324.html">...continue reading full post.</a>

			Clinical lecture theatre
		</h5>

		<p type="photo"> 
			Adjoining the medical wards of the hospital, the clinical lecture theatre feels like the home base for academic medicine at Korle Bu. On Friday mornings, all the medical staff (including house officers, residents, and consultants) and students attend a clinical case conference, which seems fairly similar to Grand Rounds. On other days, students may have lectures or tutorials here. <br><br>
